        "doc": "Represents a file (or group of files when `secondaryFiles` is provided) that\nwill be accessible by tools using standard POSIX file system call API such as\nopen(2) and read(2).\n\nFiles are represented as objects with `class` of `File`.  File objects have\na number of properties that provide metadata about the file.\n\nThe `location` property of a File is a URI that uniquely identifies the\nfile.  Implementations must support the file:// URI scheme and may support\nother schemes such as http://.  The value of `location` may also be a\nrelative reference, in which case it must be resolved relative to the URI\nof the document it appears in.  Alternately to `location`, implementations\nmust also accept the `path` property on File, which must be a filesystem\npath available on the same host as the CWL runner (for inputs) or the\nruntime environment of a command line tool execution (for command line tool\noutputs).\n\nIf no `location` or `path` is specified, a file object must specify\n`contents` with the UTF-8 text content of the file.  This is a \"file\nliteral\".  File literals do not correspond to external resources, but are\ncreated on disk with `contents` with when needed for a executing a tool.\nWhere appropriate, expressions can return file literals to define new files\non a runtime.  The maximum size of `contents` is 64 kilobytes.\n\nThe `basename` property defines the filename on disk where the file is\nstaged.  This may differ from the resource name.  If not provided,\n`basename` must be computed from the last path part of `location` and made\navailable to expressions.\n\nThe `secondaryFiles` property is a list of File or Directory objects that\nmust be staged in the same directory as the primary file.  It is an error\nfor file names to be duplicated in `secondaryFiles`.\n\nThe `size` property is the size in bytes of the File.  It must be computed\nfrom the resource and made available to expressions.  The `checksum` field\ncontains a cryptographic hash of the file content for use it verifying file\ncontents.  Implementations may, at user option, enable or disable\ncomputation of the `checksum` field for performance or other reasons.\nHowever, the ability to compute output checksums is required to pass the\nCWL conformance test suite.\n\nWhen executing a CommandLineTool, the files and secondary files may be\nstaged to an arbitrary directory, but must use the value of `basename` for\nthe filename.  The `path` property must be file path in the context of the\ntool execution runtime (local to the compute node, or within the executing\ncontainer).  All computed properties should be available to expressions.\nFile literals also must be staged and `path` must be set.\n\nWhen collecting CommandLineTool outputs, `glob` matching returns file paths\n(with the `path` property) and the derived properties. This can all be\nmodified by `outputEval`.  Alternately, if the file `cwl.output.json` is\npresent in the output, `outputBinding` is ignored.\n\nFile objects in the output must provide either a `location` URI or a `path`\nproperty in the context of the tool execution runtime (local to the compute\nnode, or within the executing container).\n\nWhen evaluating an ExpressionTool, file objects must be referenced via\n`location` (the expression tool does not have access to files on disk so\n`path` is meaningless) or as file literals.  It is legal to return a file\nobject with an existing `location` but a different `basename`.  The\n`loadContents` field of ExpressionTool inputs behaves the same as on\nCommandLineTool inputs, however it is not meaningful on the outputs.\n\nAn ExpressionTool may forward file references from input to output by using\nthe same value for `location`.\n",

Implementations may provide resolvers which map\nthese software identifer IRIs to some configuration action; or they can\nuse only the name from the `package` field on a best effort basis.\n\nFor example, the IRI https://packages.debian.org/bowtie could\nbe resolved with `apt-get install bowtie`. The IRI\nhttps://anaconda.org/bioconda/bowtie could be resolved with `conda\ninstall -c bioconda bowtie`.\n\nIRIs can also be system independent and used to map to a specific\nsoftware installation or selection mechanism.\nUsing [RRID](https://www.identifiers.org/rrid/) as an example:\nhttps://identifiers.org/rrid/RRID:SCR_005476\ncould be fulfilled using the above mentioned Debian or bioconda\npackage, a local installation managed by [Environement Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/),\nor any other mechanism the platform chooses. IRIs can also be from\nidentifer sources that are discipline specific yet still system\nindependent. As an example, the equivalent [ELIXIR Tools and Data\nService Registry](https://bio.tools) IRI to the previous RRID example is\nhttps://bio.tools/tool/bowtie2/version/2.2.8.\nIf supported by a given registry, implementations are encouraged to\nquery these system independent sofware identifier IRIs directly for\nlinks to packaging systems.\n\nA site specific IRI can be listed as well. For example, an academic\ncomputing cluster using Environement Modules could list the IRI\n`https://hpc.example.edu/modules/bowtie-tbb/1.22` to indicate that\n`module load bowtie-tbb/1.1.2` should be executed to make available\n`bowtie` version 1.1.2 compiled with the TBB library prior to running\nthe accompanying Workflow or CommandLineTool. Note that the example IRI\nis specific to a particular institution and computing environment as\nthe Environment Modules system does not have a common namespace or\nstandardized naming convention.\n\nThis last example is the least portable and should only be used if\nmechanisms based off of the `package` field or more generic IRIs are\nunavailable or unsuitable. While harmless to other sites, site specific\nsoftware IRIs should be left out of shared CWL descriptions to avoid\nclutter.\n"

A workflow is\ncomplete when all steps have been executed.\n\nDependencies between parameters are expressed using the `source` field on\n[workflow step input parameters](#WorkflowStepInput) and [workflow output\nparameters](#WorkflowOutputParameter).\n\nThe `source` field expresses the dependency of one parameter on another\nsuch that when a value is associated with the parameter specified by\n`source`, that value is propagated to the destination parameter.  When all\ndata links inbound to a given step are fufilled, the step is ready to\nexecute.\n\n## Workflow success and failure\n\nA completed step must result in one of `success`, `temporaryFailure` or\n`permanentFailure` states.  An implementation may choose to retry a step\nexecution which resulted in `temporaryFailure`.  An implementation may\nchoose to either continue running other steps of a workflow, or terminate\nimmediately upon `permanentFailure`.\n\n* If any step of a workflow execution results in `permanentFailure`, then\nthe workflow status is `permanentFailure`.\n\n* If one or more steps result in `temporaryFailure` and all other steps\ncomplete `success` or are not executed, then the workflow status is\n`temporaryFailure`.\n\n* If all workflow steps are executed and complete with `success`, then the\nworkflow status is `success`.\n\n# Extensions\n\n[ScatterFeatureRequirement](#ScatterFeatureRequirement) and\n[SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) are\navailable as standard [extensions](#Extensions_and_Metadata) to core\nworkflow semantics.\n",
